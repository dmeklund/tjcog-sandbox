                    <p>This interactive data and mapping tool standardizes
                        over 20 datasets from a variety of city, state, and
                        federal sources to present over 100 indicators on
                        New York Cityâ€™s housing and neighborhoods. It
                        includes housing subsidy information, as well as
                        neighborhood level information on housing
                        markets, home affordability, demographics, and
