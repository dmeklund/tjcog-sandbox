                <p>This interactive data and mapping tool standardizes
                    over 20 datasets from a variety of city, state, and
                    federal sources to present over 100 indicators on
                    New York Cityâ€™s housing and neighborhoods. It
                    includes housing subsidy information, as well as
                    neighborhood level information on housing
                    markets, home affordability, demographics, and
                    neighborhood conditions.</p>

                    This allows users to identify currently subsidized properties in the city, the
                    subsidy type and program applicable to specific properties, and the start and end
                    date for the subsidy on a property, allowing the user to identify properties at risk

                    of exiting from affordability restrictions.
